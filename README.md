# Hi, I'm Akash Singh! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Hi! I'm a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student at **NSUT** (Batch of 2026), a former intern at **Morgan Stanley** as a Technology Analyst. Iâ€™m passionate about building web and mobile applications, contributing to open source, and using technology to create social impact.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve actively participated in hackathons: **winning 2** and becoming a finalist in 3, which has helped me grow as a developer and team player. Iâ€™ve also contributed to open source through **Hacktoberfest 2024** and enjoy being part of the global developer community.. I love exploring new tools, collaborating with like-minded peers, and turning ideas into meaningful projects.

Beyond tech, I'm a **NSS volunteer**, where I contribute to community service initiatives and believe in giving back to society.
